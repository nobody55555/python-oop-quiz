## 📝 Note About Scoring

The scoring system is intentionally simple - you self-assess whether you got each answer correct. This honor-system approach:
- Encourages honest self-reflection
- Focuses on learning rather than "gaming" the system
- Works better for knowledge retention
- Puts you in control of your learning pace
